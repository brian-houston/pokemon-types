# pokemon-types

In the Pokemon video games, an attack can be more or less effective against a certain Pokemon depending on the type of the attack and the type of the defending Pokemon. For example, a water type move is twice as effective against fire type Pokemon. 

When a defending Pokemon has two types, then the attack multiplier is the product of the multipliers for each type. I extended this pattern to find the attack multiplier for every combination of Pokemon's 18 types. The results are in "complete_chart.csv". The file "complete_chart2.csv" is an alternative chart that ignores immunities.
